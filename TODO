Make sure that maild never tries to make an SMTP connection to itself.
It should immediately bounce in that case.  or should it just hold it
and log a complaint?  I prefer to err on the side of not bouncing.. so
that a sysadmin can make fixes and get a message to go through after
discovering the problem.

Optionally honor Errors-To header.

Possibility:
  Messages w/o a To, Cc: or Bcc: header should have one of them
  automatically addeded.  The method in which this is done should be
  configurable.  Sendmail has the following options:
   don't do anything
   add a To: header
   add Apparently-To: header 
   add empty Bcc: header 
   add To: undisclosed:; header 


RFCs 1891 and 1894 discuss standards for delivery status notification 
 (bounces, return receipts, etc).  Gotta make MIME messages, etc. bleh

change the way I have the local hooks.  They should be things that can
be in the config file.. or calls to external programs... that way, no
recompile will be necessary for user changes.  Just need to describe
how the external programs should report their status.  I only use one
status, though..  good==0, bad==nonzero.

sendmail has a connect timeout (defaults to the kernel's timeout) and
an iconnect timeout.  The latter is used to immediately send mail to
responsive hosts.  It is a short timeout (a few seconds).  If it times
out, the messsage is send backgrounded instead.

Disk space checker.  Don't accept mails if the spool directory has
less than 'x' blocks free.  The error message:
   452 4.4.5 Insufficient disk space; try again later
